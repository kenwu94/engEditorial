                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p class="drop-cap">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved and caused a transformation of how society works, influencing everyday life. Among the sectors affected by this technological wave, education stands out, where students and educators increasingly rely on AI for tailored learning assistance. According to O'Connell (2025), 86% of college students, 56% of U.S. students, and 65% of Harvard University students now use AI in their studies.</p>
                            
                            <p>For educators, AI has become more than just a buzzword. Educators are using AI to automate tedious administrative work, helping generate lesson plans, giving instant feedback, and even drafting some emails. By saving time on these tedious tasks, educators have the opportunity to spend more time connecting with their students.</p>

                            <h2>Making Learning Accessible with AI</h2>
                            <p>One of the most exciting ways AI is transforming the learning space is by making education more accessible for everyone. Imagine a classroom where students who speak different languages and who have different hearing abilities are all able to learn the same content – AI is making this possible.</p>

                            <p>Transcription tools have existed for a while already, but one of the issues with those tools prior to AI was that they did not capture tone, or nuances accurately. AI-powered transcription tools are able to do all that and more. They are able to translate lessons in real-time, not just word-for-word, but in context. This means idioms, phrases, and cultural nuances are more accurately conveyed than with simple translation apps. For multilingual learners, this opens doors to fully understanding the material and participating without constantly struggling with language. Of course, AI isn't perfect by any means. Translations can still stumble with less common languages or complex grammar. And there's a chance students might rely too much on translation tools instead of building their own language skills.</p>

                            <p>For students with disabilities, AI can make lessons easier to access and understand. Live captions and accurate transcripts help deaf and hard-of-hearing learners follow spoken instruction whether that be live-lectures or a video while also supporting attention and memory for everyone in the class. Text-to-speech and adjustable reading levels can also assist students with dyslexia or low vision. Speech-recognition practice can support articulation and language development for learners who benefit from structured oral feedback (U.S. Department of Education, 2023).</p>

                            <h2>Personalized Learning That Adapts to You</h2>
                            <p>AI is also revolutionizing learning by introducing personalized tutoring that adapts to each individual's learning style. AI tools can 'gamify' content, generate custom flashcards and provide instant feedback in addition to the many ways you can use AI to personalize learning. A study by Khoshnoodifar et al. (2023) found that gamified learning environments, when optimized with appropriate feedback and challenge elements, can significantly enhance student engagement and academic achievement. The research suggests that integrating gamification into educational settings can lead to improved learning outcomes by making the learning process more interactive and enjoyable.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan Academy's GPT-4-powered chatbot, Khanmigo, is a prime example of an effective AI personalized tutor. Developers carefully designed it to promote active learning, because research shows that if students use AI merely as an "answer bot," it can actually hinder critical thinking. A study by the University of Pennsylvania found that GPT-based tools improved problem-solving performance by 48%, but removing the AI led to a 17% drop in performance—a decline that disappears when safeguards are in place to encourage critical thinking (Bastani et al.).</p>

                            <h2>Balancing the Limitations</h2>
                            <p>The possibilities AI has created in terms of accessibility cannot be understated, however, they also highlight an ongoing challenge: equity. Students without reliable access to the technological tools required to use AI miss out on all of these benefits, widening the gap in learning opportunities. In short, AI can make education more accessible than ever, but it's not perfect. Teachers and students still need to use these tools thoughtfully, while acknowledging the privilege they have while using it.</p>

                            <p>AI has the potential to significantly support creative thinking, but there are also significant negative impacts on creativity. While some students stated that ChatGPT aided their brainstorming process by helping them get over writer's block or expanding on their own original ideas, others expressed concern over how outsourcing their thinking to AI affected their own creative skill sets.</p>

                            <p>When prompted with questions for the usage of a paper clip, where the paper clip was 200 feet tall and made of foam rubber, students who used ChatGPT did not come up with anything "out-of-the-box". The phrasing of the question was meant to challenge the assumptions for the typical use of a paper clip, allowing for a broader range of original and creative answers.</p>

                            <p>ChatGPT is unable to come up with new ideas as its entire model is based upon things people have said before, but it is able to help rephrase one's original ideas and to increase their informative quality. Being thoughtful about how AI is integrated into creative education is essential in nurturing a symbiotic relationship between student creativity and artificial intelligence.

                            <p>Generative AI has made it easier than ever to quickly draft an essay, solve a problem set, or clean up grammar. This is why "AI-assisted plagiarism" worries so many instructors. Although AI tools can help students learn and get feedback faster, it also has the detriment of eroding problem-solving skills. As such, methods to reduce the usage of AI for homework and research tasks have been adopted by many academic institutions.</p>

                            <h2>AI Detection</h2>
                            <p>There are various methods of checking whether a piece of writing is AI generated. One of which is to use plagiarism checkers such as TurnItIn (which has adapted AI checking) or GPTZero to determine whether a piece of work was done by a student or a machine. However, these methods are often unreliable and may provide inaccurate results and may unfairly flag a student for "using AI" despite having done the work originally. There has been a massive increase in academic integrity violations caused by AI tools. According to Goodier, in the UK, the number of academic integrity violations using AI tools between 2023 and 2024 was 5.1 for every 1000 students from only 1.6 per 1000 students in 2022-2023</p>

                            <p>AI is now part of everyday learning; however, it is a double edged sword. It has a wide range of benefits: accessibility, personalized learning, and more. On the other hand, it can also create shortcuts that blur authorship, narrow creativity, and deepen equity gaps across schools. From our overall research and in our own examples, we found that the outcomes depend on design and transparency.</p>
